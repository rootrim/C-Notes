# Nested Nightmares

---

After a normal hard-working 8th class day I went to my
bed very normally but I was unaware to what will happen...

I layed on bed and slept.

I was in office of a hospital. I looked around and tried
to find a familiar face but I couldn't find it then I went
to outside. The warm sun was shining on my face and I must
admit this was very relaxing. The world was looks like
saying "There is no problem. Everything is okay.".

I saw a car that trying to go out of the autopark and I
started to coming closer to help. When I was about 1 or 2
meters away to him, a dog barked and I jumped one step back.

I started to escape him but the dog is quite hard opponent
for runing so I decided to face with the dog then I stopped
and turned back to the dog. I was planning to punch the dog
in face but the dog stopped to run and I heard a truck korn.
After this I saw the lights.

I was died.

I woke up in our family's car. My father was driving the car.
I was laying at the cars back. The outside was raining and
it was quite cold.

After I woke up, my father and I have a conversation like this:

Me: "Dad, where are we going?"
My Father: "To hospital."

Me: "For what?"
My Father: "For... cure."

Me: "For who?"
My Father: "..."

My father didn't reply so I got little bit confused. I
checked the time and I saw the time is 7 A.M. I asked my
father "Why we are going to hospital at 7 A.M. This is too
early". He didn't reply and made a sharp turn. I almost fell.
But my father didn't move at all after that we were going up
a hill. When we were very close to the top of hill, the car
slipped off and rolled over then I saw the lights.

I was died. Again...

I woke up at top of my desk and I was in a 8th class english
lesson. I thought I had fallen asleep on desk so I continued
normally. After school I went to the thursday bazaar and I bought
some pickles from there then I started walking to home with
eating pickles that I bought.

While I was walking to home, our neighborhoods bully girls
came to me and they asked "Could you give us some pickles?"
and I said "No, Those are my pickles!" Then they got angry
and they said "Then we will take it from you."

I started to run away from they but useless. They were three,
but I was alone. My plan was suprising one of them with a
strong puch and running but when I tried to punch one of
them the things didn't go well.

Their elder brother came in and he take my head and started
to slamming my head to the ground and while he was slamming,
he said "Don't you know attacking girls is illegal?! Especially
my sisters." then I saw the lights.

I was died 3rd time.

I got up in a operation car. There were four people in car.
They looked like terrorists then I realised I was in
terrorists operation car and I was in a terrorist suit.
I asked "Where are we going?" one of them replied "Did you
hit your head on something, Gladowski? We are going to raid
some Arabian houses as you ordered." Then I said "Okay, I
remember. We are here for the money." They laughed, I laughed
too...

When we reached to the combat zone my head started to spin.
I said "Don't wait me! Explore the area I will bi here about
5 or 6 minutes" to my soldiers or whatever.

Suddenly a door opened from the wall that I lean on. I was
curious about it's inside so I went in and I see the Cem Yılmaz
at there then I was like "What the hell is going on here?!"
Cem Yılmaz replied "We will get out of here. They are using
you." I said "So what we gonna' do about then." Cem Yılmaz
pointed a ladder and said "We will go up from there." I
laughed "From there _laugs_ what after then we will teleport
or something _laughs_" but Cem Yılmaz was very serious so
at the end we climbed up the ladders.

After this we were at a city centre. I can't believe my eyes
we were teleported. I thanked to Cem Yılmaz and I went to
somewere else.

It was nighttime, someone came to me with his car then he
hopped out of his car. He grabbed me and threw me into his
car. I said "What is happening? Why do you doing this?" He
said "Calm down boss. We are searchng you for weeks. The last
job that we take popped in our hand and you have to fix this.
'Cause you got lost at the most important part of the job.
You will die if you can't do this. Do you understand Boss(!)"
I said "Yeah, I understood so what I am gonna' do?" He said
"Rob the centre bank. Too simple, rob the bank and bring us
the money that you steal okay?" Then I said "Okay. I understand."

Two days later -The robbing day- I was in a big trouble.
Robbing the city centre's bank is not easy and I just have one
Ak-47 and three partners. I assigned one of them as a lookout
at outside, the other two one comed with me. We hopped in to
the bank but suddenly alarms started to ringing. Police and
the other security forces came in and they anounced "We find
the Big Boss of the cartels, the Gladowski!"

I realised all of was a trap to caught me! Then I activated the
my big emergency plan. I pulled out my special smoke bombs and
threw all of it then I used the secret Joestar Family technique
"Nigerundayo!" Special smoke bombs was poisioned the security
forces so I escaped quite easily.

After that I got in the car outside and drove to the our home
village to find a peacefull life.

As soon as I arrived to our home village my mother came
to say "Welcome to home! Your father will be here at 6 o'clock"
then I said "Then I'll go to collect some firewood." my mother
confirmed and I went to forest after that.
